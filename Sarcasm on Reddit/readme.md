Context
This dataset contains 1.3 million Sarcastic comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit. The dataset was generated by scraping comments from Reddit (not by me :)) containing the \s ( sarcasm) tag. This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content.

Content
